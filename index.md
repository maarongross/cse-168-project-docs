# CSE 168 Final Project
## By Nicholas Nakano and Matthew Gross
## Objectives
In this project, we aimed to implement Volumetric Lighting, Glass BSDFs, and .obj and .mtl file import support. 
- We implemented Single Scattering and Volumetric Lighting by following implementation from [UCSD's CSE 272 class](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/cse272/wi2023/homework2.pdf), and Pixar's SIGGRAPH 2017 [presentation](https://graphics.pixar.com/library/ProductionVolumeRendering/paper.pdf).
- We implemented basic .obj and .mtl import support using the [Wikipedia page for Wavefront .obj files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file). To test our implementation (and for our final images), we used .obj and .mtl files from [Florida State University's website on .obj files](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/obj/obj.html)
- We implemented Glass BSDFs using [lecture slides](http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2024/lecture/brdfs) from Carnegie Mellon University.
