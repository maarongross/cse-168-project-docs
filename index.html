    <h1>CSE 168 Final Project</h1>
    <h2>By Matthew Gross and Nicholas Nakano</h2>
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>Our goal is to implement the following extensions to our current path-tracer implementation:
        <ul>
            <li>Realtime Rendering</li>
            <li>Volumetric Lighting (implementation structure from <i>insert link here</i>)</li>
            <li>Glass (refractive BRDFs)</li>
            <li>compatibility with .obj files</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>To demonstrate these features, we will be attempting to render a car in foggy conditions.</p>

    <p>The volumetric lighting features will render the exhaust gases while a glass shader will render the windows. Furthermore, we need to add .obj file compatibility to render the car model.</p>
    <h3>What we have so far:</h3>
    <p>Following volumetric path-tracing write-ups from UCSD Graduate School Classes, we've achieved very primitive volumetric lighting. This currently only includes the rendering of monochromatic absorption-only homogeneous volumes.</p>

    <p>Our next immediate goal is to model the scattering of light from other emissive sources into other volumes.</p>
