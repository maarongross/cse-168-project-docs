    <h1>CSE 168 Final Project</h1>
    <h2>By Matthew Gross and Nicholas Nakano</h2>
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>Our goal is to implement the following extensions to our current pathtracer implementation:
        <ul>
            <li>Realtime Rendering</li>
            <li>Volumetric Lighting (implementation structure from <i>insert link here</i>)</li>
            <li>Glass (refractive BRDFs)</li>
            <li>a first-person demo</li>
            <li>compatibility with .obj files</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>These can all help us with our final goal of rendering a realtime scene of a 1996 BMW M3</p>

        <figcaption>Above is a picture of a 1996 BMW M3 for reference</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The volumetric lighting will help make the lights on the car more realistic, while glass will help make the car's windows see-through. Furthermore, we need to add .obj file compatibility in order to render the car model. Realtime rendering and the first person demo are extras feature that would be nice to have but are not necessary.</p>
    <h3>What we have so far</h3>
    <p>So far, we have been working on implementing volumetric lighting.</p>
